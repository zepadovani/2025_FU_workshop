# 🎵 Listening with machines, crafting transductions: technodiversity, creative tools, and critical perspectives in research-creation practices

This is the repository for the practical/hands-on part of the workshop "Listening with machines, crafting transductions: technodiversity, creative tools, and critical perspectives in research-creation practices" held at Freie Universität Berlin in March 2025.

In this session, we will explore Audio Processing and AI using Python.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run the workshop materials in two ways: **Google Colab** (recommended for beginners) or **Locally** (for users familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks).

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

No installation required. Just click the badge below to open the main notebook:

1.  Click the badge above.
2.  Sign in with your Google account if asked.
3.  Run the first cell to set up the environment automatically.
4.  Have fun!

### Option 2: Running Locally

If you prefer to run on your own machine, we use **Pixi** for environment management.

1.  **Install Pixi**: [https://pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh)
2.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zepadovani/2025_FU_workshop.git
    cd 2025_FU_workshop
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pixi install
    ```
4.  **Run the Notebook**:
    ```bash
    pixi run jupyter lab
    ```
